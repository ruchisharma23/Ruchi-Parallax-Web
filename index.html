            Dubai was Established in the 18th century as a small fishing village, Dubai grew into a regional trading 
            hub in the early 20th century and grew rapidly in the late 20th and early 21st
             centuries with a focus on tourism  and luxury.[10] It has the second 
           -most five-star hotels in the world[11] and boasts the tallest building in
             the world, the Burj Khalifa, which is 828 metres (2,717 ft) tall.Dubai is thought to have been established as a fishing village in the early 18th century
             [29] and was, by 1822, a town of some 700–800 members of the Bani Yas tribe and subject to the rule of Sheikh Tahnun bin Shakhbut of Abu Dhabi.[30] In 1822, a British naval
              surveyor noted that Dubai was at that time populated with a thousand people living in an oval-shaped town
              surrounded by a mud wall  , scattered with goats and camels. The main footpath out of the village
            led to a reedy creek while another trailed off into the desert which merged into caravan routes.

            In the eastern Arabian Peninsula, on the coast of the Persian Gulf,
            [12] it is a major global transport hub for passengers and cargo.
            [13] Oil revenue helped accelerate the development of the city, 
            which was already a major mercantile hub.In 1841, a smallpox epidemic broke out in the Bur Dubai locality, 
            forcing residents to relocate east to Deira.[32] In 1896, fire broke out in Dubai,
             a disastrous occurrence in a town where many family homes were still constructed from barasti – palm fronds.
             The conflagration consumed half the houses of Bur Dubai, while the district of Deira was said to have been totally destroyed.
              The following year more fires broke out. A female slave was caught in the act of starting one such blaze 
              and was subsequently put to death.<br></br>

            Dubai has been a centre for regional and international trade 
            since the early 20th century, and its economy relies on revenues from trade,
            tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services.[14][15][16][17] Oil
             production contributed less than 1 percent of the emirate's GDP in 2018.[18]
              The city has a population of around 3.60 million (as of 2022).Dubai's geographical proximity to Iran made it an important trade location. 
              The town of Dubai was an important port of call for foreign tradesmen, 
              chiefly those from Iran, many of whom eventually settled in the town. By the beginning 
              of the 20th century, it was an important port.[39] At that time, Dubai consisted of the town of Dubai
               and the nearby village of Jumeirah, a collection of some 45 areesh (palm leaf) huts.[37] By the 1920s, 
               many Iranians settled in Dubai  permanently, moving across the Persian Gulf.
               permanently, moving across the Persian Gulf. By then, amenities in the town grew and a
                modern quarter was established, Al Bastakiya.<br></br>
